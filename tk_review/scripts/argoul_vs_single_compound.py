Argoul 2026 (eleven PFAS as one cocktail) against the single-compound studies.

Argoul carries a lot of weight in this review: it is the only source that
measures clearance and volume for many PFAS in one experiment, which is what
sections 3 and 10 need. Every other mouse value in the database comes from a
study that dosed ONE compound. So the question is whether dosing eleven at
once, at low dose, by mixed-effects fitting, reproduces what the
one-at-a-time literature found.

The answer has a shape. Clearance and volume are both systematically LOW --
and their ratio is not. That matters, because a half-life is their ratio.

All comparators are FEMALE mouse, matching Argoul; db/animal_halflife_measured.csv
and db/combined/tk_parameters.csv. Units harmonised to days and mL/kg.

  PFHxA's volume is the one outlier (5.1x HIGH) and is held out of the mean
  below; it is also the only compound Argoul puts in net tubular secretion,
  so its kinetics differ in kind.

  Geometric mean ratio, Argoul / single-compound:
      clearance                {gm(cl_r):.2f}x   ({1/gm(cl_r):.1f}x low)
      volume, excluding PFHxA  {gm(vd_no_hxa):.2f}x   ({1/gm(vd_no_hxa):.1f}x low)

  Both low, by similar factors. Hold on to that -- it is the whole result.

  One caveat on how much of a check that is. In most of these studies Vd is
  not measured apart from clearance: non-compartmental analysis gives
  Vz = CL/lambda_z and Vss = CL*MRT, and Lou's clearance is ke*Vd derived in
  this review. So for Lou, Sundstrom and the EPA PFHxA value, "clearance low
  AND volume low" is largely one observation seen twice. Fujii 2015 is the
  exception: Vd from Dose/C(0) by back-extrapolation, CL from Dose/AUC, which
  are independent. There CL is 0.38x and Vd 0.59x -- both low, independently.
  One row is thin evidence, so the defensible statement is the narrower one:
  the RATE CONSTANT agrees across ten comparisons and the SCALE does not.

  Three candidate causes, none separable with the data in hand:

   DOSE      Argoul dosed 0.019-1.55 mg/kg, 10-100x below the comparators.
             Section 8's saturable-reabsorption account predicts clearance
             rising with dose, and the one three-point series available
             (PFHxS female, 0.094 / 1 / 20 mg/kg across two laboratories)
             does rise monotonically: CL 1.3 / 2.68 / 3.79, slope +0.20 on
             log-log. Argoul sits at the bottom of that trend, not off it.

   COCKTAIL  Eleven PFAS dosed together could compete for the same
             reabsorptive transporters. That would RAISE clearance, not lower
             it, so it argues against the observed direction -- unless the
             competition is for plasma binding sites instead, which would
             raise the unbound fraction and lower the apparent volume.

   METHOD    Nonlinear mixed-effects fitting shrinks estimates toward the
             population mean; non-compartmental analysis does not. Shrinkage
             would compress the spread rather than shift the centre, so it is
             the weakest of the three.

  The useful conclusion for this review: Argoul's WITHIN-experiment contrasts
  (section 3's 5,254x clearance span against 7.7x in Vss) are unaffected,
  because a shared scaling cancels from a ratio. Its ABSOLUTE clearances are
  what section 10's endpoint R is built from, and those carry a roughly 2-3x
  low bias relative to the single-compound literature.""")
