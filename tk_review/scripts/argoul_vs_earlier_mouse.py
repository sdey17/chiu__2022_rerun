How do Argoul 2026's mouse clearances and volumes compare with earlier values?

Argoul 2026 is the only study that measures CL and Vd for eleven PFAS in one
experiment, so it carries a lot of weight in this review (sections 3 and 10).
That makes it worth asking whether its numbers agree with what was already
published for the mouse -- and if not, whether the disagreement has a
structure.

Three design differences matter before any number is compared:

  SEX     Argoul dosed FEMALE mice. Several earlier mouse values are male, or
          pooled. The mouse sex difference is small for PFOA (1.2-1.7x) but
          not zero.
  DOSE    Argoul dosed 0.019-1.55 mg/kg, one to two orders of magnitude below
          the earlier studies. If elimination saturates, that alone predicts a
          lower clearance and a smaller volume.
  DESIGN  Argoul gave all eleven compounds as one cocktail and fitted them
          simultaneously by nonlinear mixed effects; the earlier studies dosed
          one compound at a time and fitted non-compartmentally.

    Both rise with dose, monotonically, across three points from two

    A positive clearance slope is what saturable REABSORPTION predicts
    (section 8): more escapes when the transporter is swamped. Dose therefore
    explains the direction of the PFOA and PFHxS disagreements, and with only
    three points it is a consistency check rather than a fitted relationship.

    It does not explain PFHxA, where Argoul's volume is 5x HIGHER. PFHxA is
    also the compound Argoul finds in net tubular secretion, so its kinetics
    differ in kind from the others and a single explanation should not be
    expected to cover it.""")
