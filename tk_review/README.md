# PFAS toxicokinetics review

Why PFAS serum half-lives differ between humans, rats and mice; what each
reported half-life assumed; and whether exposure level is related to half-life
or to volume of distribution.

Built on top of the existing work in this repository (`../literature`,
`../species_dose`, `../pfas_dose`), which it extends rather than repeats.
See the [root README](../README.md) for how this fits with the other strands.

## Where things are

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `report/REPORT.md` | the written review — start here |
| `report/PFAS_TK_review.pdf` | the printable review — 12 pages, 14 sections, 51 numbered references; rebuild with `scripts/make_summary_pdf.py` (needs `reportlab`) |
| `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` | the same argument in two pages |
| `db/` | the structured extractions — one CSV per evidence type |
| `db/primary_2026/` | 24 per-paper extractions, read from the papers directly |
| `db/combined/` | the consolidated database — 1,438 rows across four tables, plus an `.xlsx` |
| `db/qsar/` | per-compound structure descriptors paired with the renal handling ratio (§11) |
| `papers/` | full-text extractions (`.txt`) and the retrieval logs (`SOURCES_*.md`) |
| `figures/` | 16 analysis figures; `fig00_master.png` is the whole argument in one panel pair |
| `scripts/` | everything that generates the above, runnable in order |
| `research_notes/` | the per-subtopic research notes behind the extractions |
| `WANTED.md` | papers still wanted, and why each one would settle something |

## The databases

`EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` is the two-page version: the five findings, what this
work corrects in the published record (including in its own earlier output), and
the one question still genuinely open.

`SUMMARY.md` is the illustrated standalone summary with full citations.

`WANTED.md` lists only what is still missing — the 11 full texts supplied during
this work have been removed from it.

`scripts/fetch_papers.sh` re-downloads the agency PDFs listed in
`papers/DOWNLOAD_MANIFEST.csv`.

## Provenance

Every number in `db/` carries the study, year, PMID or DOI, and the table or
page it came from. Nothing is quoted from memory. Where a value was taken from
another paper's citation rather than the original, the row says so.

**The PDFs are not in git.** They are ~110 MB of freely available government
documents at stable URLs. Their text extractions (`papers/*.txt`) *are*
committed, and those are what every number was read from. `papers/SOURCES_*.md`
logs every retrieval attempt, successes and failures alike, with URLs and dates.

## Two things to know before reading the databases

**The supplied citation list is a hazard corpus, not a toxicokinetic one.**
Of its 81 entries, 42 cannot contribute a half-life, Vd, clearance or binding
constant — they are immunotoxicity, steatosis and gene-expression studies. A
further 21 are repeat-dose toxicity studies that measured internal
concentration without reporting kinetics; those are flagged
`supplies_internal_dose` because a measured serum level at a known administered
dose is still a usable datum.

**Units are mixed in the upstream source.** `../species_dose/species_exposure.csv`
reports Chiu's human half-lives in *years* and the EPA animal fits in *days*,
with no units column. `master_exposure_halflife.csv` carries an explicit
`native_time_unit` column and normalised `halflife_d` / `halflife_y` columns.
