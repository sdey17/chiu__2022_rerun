LESSON 8 -- Solving the model numerically, which is how PBPK is done.

Everything so far used a CLOSED FORM: someone solved the differential
equation once, by hand, and we evaluated the formula. That works for one
compartment, for two, and for almost nothing else.

A PBPK model has an equation per organ, blood flows coupling them, and
often a saturable term. It has no closed form. You write down dC/dt and
hand it to a numerical integrator.

This lesson makes that switch on models you already trust, so you can
check the machinery against a known answer before relying on it. Then it
does something the closed form cannot: saturable elimination.

   Two habits worth forming now:
     * always check `sol.success`; a silent failure returns garbage
     * always verify a new ODE against a case you can solve by hand,

   clearance rose with dose (beta = +0.11), half-life fell. Simple
   saturable reabsorption of the kind modelled here cannot produce

QUESTIONS
  1. In section A, why does asking for rtol=1e-12 cost more function
     evaluations than rtol=1e-3? What is the integrator actually doing
     differently?
  2. Section B tracks amounts, not concentrations. Rewrite rhs_2comp in
     concentrations and you need V1 and V2 explicitly. Which form would
     you rather debug in a model with ten organs?
  3. In section C, the apparent half-life RISES with dose. Our rat data
     showed it FALLING. Sketch a mechanism that gives the falling sign.
     (Hint: what if the saturating transporter moves chemical back INTO
     the blood rather than out of it?)
  4. Section D integrates inside the objective function. If one
     integration takes 10 ms and the optimiser needs 500 evaluations,
     how long is the fit? Now make it Bayesian with 8000 MCMC draws.
     What does that tell you about why PBPK models are fitted the way
     they are?

EXERCISES
  a. Add an oral dose to rhs_1comp: a second state for the gut, with
     dA_gut/dt = -ka*A_gut and the blood gaining ka*A_gut/Vd. Check it
     against tk.oral_1comp.
  b. Add a CONTINUOUS input (drinking water) instead of a bolus:
     dC/dt = DWI*DWC/Vd - k*C, starting from C(0) = 0. Run it for 30
     years. You have now built Chiu's human model (../model.py) --
     compare your steady state to DWI*DWC/(k*Vd).
  c. Repeat exercise b but make DWC drop to zero at year 10, as happens
     when a town switches water supply. This is exactly the kind of
     question a closed form cannot answer and an ODE can.
  d. Take the saturable model from section C and give it a continuous
     input. Is there still a steady state if the input exceeds Vmax?
     What does the model do instead, and is that physically sensible?
